- Decide format for the competition: 
     - will we have a single session? Two sessions? Daily sessions? 
     - How many times will we simulate games? 
     - Will we have a dry-run? 
     - How many games to simulate?
     - Some way for competitors to improve their models over the course of the rounds?
- Decide rules for legal words
     - Implement rules for legal words
- Select/generate wordlist for words from which the boards are generated
- How to ensure that all of the libraries contestants want to use are available?
- Write requirements.txt for contestant submissions
- What restrictions do we need to consider? (e.g. filesize, time to run, others?)
- What compute are we going to use? Who is going to pay for it?
- What will the prizes be? Who will supply?
- How will competitors send in their entries?
     - What info do we need to collect?
- Do we want to give a "better" model example? Or is that influencing the direction of the competitors too much?
- How to deal with submissions that generate errors?
- Incorporate error handling?
- Write code to generate "schedules" (e.g. round-robin?)
- Any legal considerations?
